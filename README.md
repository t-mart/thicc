# thicc

Convert characters to their fullwidth representation

## Usage Examples

* **Pipe in text from standard input**

    ```bash
    $ echo "foo" | thc
    ```
    
    ```bash
    ｆｏｏ
    ```

* **Pass a filename argument**

    ```bash
    $ thc thatfile
    ```
    
    ```bash
    ｂａｒ
    ```

* **Reverse fullwidth text**

    ```bash
    $ thc -r <<<ｂａｚ
    ```
    
    `<<<` is not special thicc syntax. It is a shell "herestring". It is one of many ways to pass standard input to a
    program on your shell.
    
    ```bash
    baz
    ```
